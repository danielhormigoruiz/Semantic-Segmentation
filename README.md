# Semantic Segmentation
### Introduction
In this project, you'll label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

### Setup
##### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
##### Dataset
Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.

### Start

##### Flags on ```main.py```
 - ```save```: [DON'T CHANGE IT] This flag is for avoid errors when testing the functions, due to when training the network we need to save the Â  models, and this sends an error when we are testing the function.
 - ```testing_functions```: This flag is for launch the tests. If it is true, then the tests are launched. By default is False.
 - ```training```: This flag is for training the network. Therefore, if it is True, then the FCN will be trained. By default is False. 
##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
```
python main.py
```

### Output
The output image will be a segmented one in which the FCN has labeled each pixel as road (green) or not road (initial value).
